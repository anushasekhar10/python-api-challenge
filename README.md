Python_Api_Challenge

This challenge is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

**Part 1: WeatherPy**

Using the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities.csv we will create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

We will also Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

**Part 2: VacationPy**

Using the weather data skills we will plan future vacations and learn to use the Geoapify API

Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame.

Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.

find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.
