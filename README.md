Python_Api_Challenge

This challenge is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.
Part 1: WeatherPy

using the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities.csv we will create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

We will also Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

Part 2: VacationPy
Using the weather data skills we will plan future vacations and learn to use the Geoapify API
